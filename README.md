# 👋 Greetings! I'm Jonathan Gelin.

👨‍🚀 As a freelance software architect, my journey revolves around crafting efficient web solutions with a focus on JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, and expertise in [Nrwl/Nx](https://nx.dev/) alongside its ecosystem.

My passion extends across the spectrum of frontend frameworks, with a fondness for [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), complemented by a profound mastery in [Angular](https://angular.dev/).

🚀 I thrive on streamlining development processes, from managing vast codebases to refining deployment and testing phases.

🛠️ I take pride in devising robust testing frameworks, utilizing tools like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), and [Jest](https://jestjs.io), to fortify code integrity.

🔄 My experience encompasses crafting and implementing effective continuous integration workflows, facilitating a smooth evolution from development through to production.

🏗️ I'm intrigued by the potential of micro-frontend architectures, employing [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) and [Webpack Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) for modular, scalable app structures.

🎨 Design systems captivate me, especially when harmonizing UI components with tools like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org).

🔄 Embracing agility, I champion collaboration, adaptability, and perpetual growth. Adhering to extreme programming tenets, I prioritize communication, simplicity, and feedback, driving toward an efficient, robust, and value-oriented development lifecycle.
